# Personal Website
You can visit my personal website here: https://canadiancrafter.github.io/. Currenty, it includes a profile page about me (no idea why anyone would venture there) and a photo gallery (cause I do photography). In the near future, I aim to add a blog as well as a Chinese translation of the website to practice my Chinese. I already have the code done for a computer projects portfolio, but I don't have many projects I'm especially proud of yet.

Aside from a bit of code I did for a hackathon, I had next to no experience in HTML, CSS, or JS before starting this project. Thanks to [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net) and [Lokesh Dhakar's Lightbox Script](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/), which did a lot of the heavy lifting, and showed me the ropes. It was only by studying and using their work that I gained some cursory knowledge in using HTML.
