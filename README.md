# Personal Website
You can visit my personal website here: https://canadiancrafter.github.io/. Currenty, it includes a profile page about me (no idea why anyone would venture there), a computer project portfolio, and a [photo gallery](https://canadiancrafter.github.io/photography.html) (as my coding portfolio is quite bare). In the near future, I aim to add a blog as well as a Chinese translation of the website to practice my Chinese ([WIP](https://canadiancrafter.github.io/photography-cn.html)). 

I had next to no experience in HTML, CSS, or JS when I began this project. Thanks to [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net) and [Lokesh Dhakar's Lightbox Script](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/), which did a lot of the heavy lifting, and showed me the ropes. It was only by studying their work that I gained some cursory knowledge in HTML.
